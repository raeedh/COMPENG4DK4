\section*{Random Number Generator Seeds}
For the experiments in this lab, we used the same set of 8 random number seeds for all experiments. Experiment 1 instructs us to include runs with our \textit{McMaster Student ID numbers} as our seeds. We used our \textit{McMaster IDs} and shifted them by one digit at a time to create 4 different seeds from each our IDs, for a total of 8 different seeds. All the random number generator seeds can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:random_seeds}. In the C code used for the experiments, leading zeroes are removed.
