\section*{Experiment 4}
% Repeat Part 2 but this time set the SERVICE TIME to 30 and vary ARRIVAL RATE over a suitable range. Compare the mean delay vs. ARRIVAL RATE curve to what you obtained before. Plot this curve on a graph with the curve from Part 2. Explain the differences in the curves.
When setting the \texttt{SERVICE\_TIME} to 30, we similarly adjusted our \texttt{ARRIVAL\_RATE} values by dividing the rates used in experiment 2 by 3. We kept all other parameters the same (including the random number generator seeds) and re-ran the simulation. A plot of the mean delay vs. arrival rate of both experiments 2 and 4 are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:exp4}. We can see that in this experiment, with a larger service time the mean delay increases significantly faster at the same arrival rates. The mean delay at each scaled arrival rate is also three times the mean delay seen in Experiment 2 (for example, the mean delay is 54.65 at an arrival rate of 0.09 in experiment 2, and the example delay is 163.95 at an arrival rate of 0.03 in experiment 4). The baseline mean delay at low arrival rates has also increased (from 10 to 30) to match the increased service time.
