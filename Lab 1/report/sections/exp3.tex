\section*{Experiment 3}
% What happens when the product of ARRIVAL RATE and SERVICE TIME, in Expression 1 is greater than 1? To see, set ARRIVAL RATE slightly greater than 1/SERVICE TIME, then do a run of 10,000 customers. What happens when you keep increasing the run length? Explain why is this happening. Explain why the condition in Expression 1 is necessary.
As we increase the arrival rate such that the product of \texttt{ARRIVAL\_RATAE} and \texttt{SERVICE\_TIME} exceeds 1, we see the fraction of customers served begins to drop.
