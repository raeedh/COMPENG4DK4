\section*{Experiment 8}
% Start with the original version of the code with SERVICE TIME set to 10. Modify the code so that instead of Poisson process arrivals, the time between arrivals is fixed with a value equal to 1/ARRIVAL RATE, i.e., the time between successive arrivals is always the same. Repeat Parts 2 and 3 above. Explain why you get such a different mean delay vs. ARRIVAL RATE curve. Explain the shape of the curve by drawing an example of what is happening in time.
