\section*{Experiment 5}
To simulate this case, the code was modified to add a FIFO queue where calls would be placed on call arrival if all channels are full. This queue would be checked on call departure (the only event that can free up a channel) and place a call from the queue into any empty channel if the queue contains a call. The modifications for call arrivals can be seen in Listing~\ref{list:exp5_arrival} and modifications for call departures can be seen in Listing~\ref{list:exp5_departure}. The values for $P_w$, $T_w$, $W(1 \text{min})$ were found in simulation and calculated with the given formulas for the following cases:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
$\lambda = 2$, $h = 3$, $N = 10$\\
Simulation results: $P_w = 0.1006$, $T_w = 0.0746$ min, $W(1 \text{min}) = 0.9739$\\
Calculated value: $P_w = 0.0974$, $T_w = 0.0730$ min, $W(1 \text{min}) = 0.9743$

\item
$\lambda = 7$, $h = 2$, $N = 15$\\
Simulation results: $P_w = 0.7198$, $T_w = 1.4224$ min, $W(1 \text{min}) = 0.5662$\\
Calculated value: $P_w = 0.6891$, $T_w = 1.3783$ min, $W(1 \text{min}) = 0.5820$

\item 
$\lambda = 2$, $h = 7$, $N = 15$\\
Simulation results: $P_w = 0.7198$, $T_w = 4.9785$ min, $W(1 \text{min}) = 0.3774$\\
Calculated value: $P_w = 0.6891$, $T_w = 4.8239$ min, $W(1 \text{min}) = 0.4026$
\end{enumerate}

The results are largely similar. There are minor discrepancies in the results as not all customers that enter the queue will be served at the end of the simulation, resulting in some undercounting or overcounting of some statistics.
