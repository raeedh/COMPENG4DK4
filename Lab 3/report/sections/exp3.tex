\section*{Experiment 3}
% Cellular networks are often designed so that under busy traffic conditions, the highest acceptable probability of blocking is about 1% (i.e., the probability of rejecting a cell-phone call is 1% because the cellular network has no available channels.) Generate a graph of maximum offered loading (in Erlangs) versus the number of cellular channels needed to achieve this blocking probability performance.
To determine the
