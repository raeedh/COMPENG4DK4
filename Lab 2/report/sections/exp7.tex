\section*{Experiment 7}
% In Part 6, now assume that voice packets are given (non-preemptive) priority over data packets, i.e., The server always serves voice packets first and data packets are only served when there are no waiting voice packets. However, once a data packet starts service, it is allowed to complete even if a new voice packet arrives. (This is the non-preemptive part.)
% Simulate this situation and compare the results you obtain with that found in Part 6. The easiest way to simulate this is to create separate voice and data packet queues. Then create separate arrival and departure events for both using the existing event functions as templates.
In Experiment 6, we observed that voice packet performance was being bottlenecked by the data packets. If we were to service voice packets from the queue first, then we should expect the performance of the voice packets to significantly increase without a large impact on the data packet performance, as voice packets are served relatively quickly.

The simulation was modified using the program from Experiment 6 as a template. Two queues were used instead of one, placing data packets and voice packets in separate queues. When the simulation checks if there is a packet to transmit, it now checks the voice packet queue first and only if it is empty will it check the data packet queue. The modifications to the transmission event logic is shown in Listing~\ref{list:exp7}.

A graph comparing the voice stream delay and data packet delay is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:exp7}. Similar to Experiment 6, we see an exponential curve for the data packet mean delay, but for the voice packet mean delay we are no longer increasing exponentially. If we zoom into the curve for the data packet delay in Figure~\ref{fig:exp7voice}, we see the mean delay now increases at a linear rate instead.
